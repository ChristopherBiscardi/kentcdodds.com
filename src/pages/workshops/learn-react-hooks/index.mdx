# Help experienced React developers get up to speed with the new built-in hooks released in React 16.8.0

## Description

React’s new hooks feature is amazing! It provides simpler ways to share code and
is altogether much simpler than anything we’ve had before. These hooks allow you
to manage state, context, refs, and run side-effect code in a way that’s simple
and maintainable in the long-term.

In this hands-on workshop, we’ll dive into the built-in hooks you’ll need on a
regular basis with simple exercises that allow you to focus on learning the new
APIs. When we’re all done, you’ll be equipped with everything you need to know
to use hooks in your application (and you’ll be eager to start!).
